      <p>Changing career paths for a profession that has always been on my mind. I choose a career path towards Engineering along with some welding courses but have decided 
        that the path i wanted to take was towards coding. I took this course to change my career as a web developer and along my way i can use my coding skills toawards the automotive 
        side of this profession.
